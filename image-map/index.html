        <p>Hello and welcome to my website. This image that you see is the logo for a snowboarding company that i hold dear to my heart, never summer snowboards. This company has been with me by my side throughout my journey of boarding and the company has never let me down. The boards are strong and can handle whatever you throw at them</p>
        <p>As you poke around this image it will link you directly to the never summer website to showcase some of the amazing lineup of snowboards that they offer. These offerings are also recommendations from myself so don't be afraid to go window shopping to find yourself the next board.</p>
        <p>Never summer is based out of Colorado and they make all the boards by hand inside the factory. Other bigger companies (like burton) use machines to mold and make the boards so its refreshing to see a company still get their hands dirty. When a company shows true craftsmanship, i really love supporting their business</p>
